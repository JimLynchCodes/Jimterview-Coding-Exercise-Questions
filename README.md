# Jimterview-Coding-Exercise-Questions
Coding exercises that I like to use during interviews.

I like to hire people who will be awesome pair programming partners! But what does that really mean? ðŸ¤”

Personally, this is what I look for in an interviewee:

- should be familiar with the syntax of the language they are people hired to code in.

- should be able to think outloud about how they are reasoning through the problem.

- should choose reasonably efficient the collections and iteration strategies.

- should be able to choose logical names and break code logically into smaller functions.

- should be able to describe different unit tests for the exercise solution.

- should be funny, friendly, polite, interesting, enthusiastic...


## Different Methods of Administering the Exercises

There are basically three different ways these exercises could be worked through, and they all have pros and cons and evern within them different variations!


### 1. In person in the office

    - At a computer (on a big screen in a meeting room)
    
    
    -  At a computer (normal desk setup)
    
    
    - On a Whiteboard
    
    
### 2. Remote Pair Programming

    - With an pair programming webapp webapp repl.it or codepad.io
    
    
    -  Using VSCode live share
    
    
    - Using regular video screenshare
    
    
### 3. Take Home Exercise 

    - Given X number of days to work on their own. Email us back a zip file of the project with no node_modules folder.
